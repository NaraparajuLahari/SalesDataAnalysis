# ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning, Preparation & Visualization Using Python

This project is a complete walkthrough of the data analysis process using Python, showcasing how raw and messy data can be transformed into meaningful insights through systematic cleaning, preparation, and visualization. It is designed to simulate the real-world tasks a data analyst performs when working with datasets that require attention before any conclusions can be drawn.

The notebook begins by importing essential Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`. It then walks through the process of loading the dataset, exploring it to understand its structure, and identifying inconsistencies or errors. The data cleaning phase addresses missing values, duplicate entries, and incorrect formats. This ensures that the data is accurate and reliable for analysis.

Once cleaned, the data is prepared for visualization by formatting dates, creating new variables, and aggregating values where needed. The project then dives into visual exploration, using charts such as histograms, bar plots, and pie charts to highlight trends, distributions, and comparisons across categories. These visuals make it easy to extract actionable insights and tell a compelling story with the data.

This project uses Python's Jupyter Notebook environment and relies heavily on the `pandas` library for manipulation, along with `seaborn` and `matplotlib` for data visualization. It is a great resource for anyone looking to strengthen their understanding of the data pipeline, particularly students, entry-level analysts, or anyone preparing a data analytics portfolio.

By the end of the notebook, you'll see how structured workflows in Python can take chaotic data and turn it into something insightful, visual, and decision-ready.
